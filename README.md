# Fragrance Analysis: Unveiling Comparable Scents and Cost-effective Options
Final Project for DS 5001: Exploratory Text Analytics


**Background**

Fragrances have a long history of being associated with wealth and luxury. From ancient Egypt to the Renaissance period, perfumes were used as a form of artistic expression and a way to display one's status. It wasn't until the 16th century that perfumes truly became a luxury item, as perfumers began using more exotic and expensive ingredients, making their fragrances even more exclusive and coveted. The French monarchy became famous for its love of perfume, with a famous quote expressing "perfume is the soul of the flower."

While perfume production techniques have improved and fragrances have generally become more accessible to the general public due to "bargain brands", certain high-end perfume houses continue to maintain an aura of exclusivity. This has contributed to the perception of perfumes as a luxury item, reserved for those who can afford to indulge in the finest scents, or to at least appear affluent.

However, the rise of social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram has changed the game, allowing for trends to cycle at lightning speed. This has made it challenging for low-income populations to keep up with the latest fashion, specifically fragrance in this case, fads. The democratization of information has the potential to inspire positive change and promote inclusivity in the beauty industry, but it also highlights the stark disparities in wealth and access to luxury goods.

**Project Goals**

This exploratory text analysis project aims to use language models to find more affordable yet comparable substitutes for expensive, luxury perfumes. This project seeks to identify which perfume notes are associated with better ratings and higher prices. By doing so, I intend to provide an alternative option for those who love the scent of a particular luxury perfume but cannot afford its price tag.

Additionally, the project aims to gain insight into the characteristics that make a perfume more desirable and expensive - ultimately shedding light on the factors that influence consumer preferences and market trends in the fragrance industry.

By achieving these goals, the results from this project could help increase accessibility and inclusivity in the world of perfume while also providing valuable insights for industry professionals and social media influencers.




In this project I:
- Converted the collection from their source formats (F0) into a set of tables that conform to the Standard Text Analytic Data Model (F2).  
- Annotated these tables with statistical and linguistic features using NLP libraries such as NLTK (F3).  
- Produced a vector representation of the corpus to generate TFIDF values to add to the TOKEN (aka CORPUS) and VOCAB tables (F4).
Model the annotated and vectorized model with tables and features derived from the application of unsupervised methods, including PCA, LDA, and word2vec (F5).  
- Explored results using statistical and visual methods.  
- Presented conclusions about patterns observed in the corpus by means of these operations.
